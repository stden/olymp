Slow solutions (O(n^3)) passes first ten tests                    - score is 40
Solution which counts degenerate triangles passes first ten tests - score is 40

Maybe we should increase time limit to 3sec? On my PC my solutions works about 1.3sec.

About triangle_vu_fasty.java:
    There is a theorem which states that the number of isosceles triangles spanned
    by three points of an n-element point set on the plane is O(n^{2.137}).
    So I don't think we can make a test on which you program timelimits.
